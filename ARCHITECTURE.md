#  OESON Capstone - Architecture Documentation

## System Design Overview

This project implements a cloud-native microservice architecture with complete DevOps automation.

## Component Architecture

### 1. Application Layer
- **Microservice**: Node.js Express application
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful API with health checks
- **Metrics**: Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoint
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration

### 2. Containerization Layer
- **Docker**: Multi-stage builds for security and optimization
- **Base Images**: node:18-alpine for minimal footprint
- **Security**: Non-root user, read-only filesystems
- **Health Checks**: Built-in container health monitoring

### 3. Orchestration Layer
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration and management
- **Deployment**: Rolling updates with zero downtime
- **Service Discovery**: Internal and external service exposure
- **Config Management**: ConfigMaps and Secrets

### 4. Infrastructure Layer
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code for AWS
- **Networking**: VPC, subnets, security groups
- **Compute**: EC2 instances for Jenkins and Kubernetes
- **Storage**: Persistent volumes for stateful applications

### 5. CI/CD Layer
- **Jenkins**: Pipeline automation and coordination
- **Stages**: Checkout  Test  Build  Push  Deploy
- **Integration**: DockerHub, Kubernetes, AWS
- **Automation**: Full lifecycle automation

### 6. Monitoring Layer
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and storage
- **Grafana**: Visualization and alerting
- **Dashboards**: Application and infrastructure monitoring
- **Alerting**: Proactive issue detection

## Data Flow

### Development Workflow
1. Developer writes code and tests locally
2. Code is committed to Git repository
3. Jenkins pipeline is automatically triggered
4. Application is built, tested, and containerized
5. Docker image is pushed to registry
6. Kubernetes deployment is updated
7. Monitoring collects and visualizes metrics

### Deployment Flow
1. Infrastructure provisioned via Terraform
2. Kubernetes cluster configured
3. Application deployed with health checks
4. Services exposed via LoadBalancer/NodePort
5. Monitoring stack deployed and configured

### Monitoring Flow
1. Application exposes metrics via /metrics endpoint
2. Prometheus scrapes metrics at regular intervals
3. Grafana queries Prometheus for visualization
4. Alerts configured for critical metrics
5. Dashboards provide real-time visibility

## Security Architecture

### Container Security
- Non-root user execution
- Read-only root filesystem
- Minimal base images
- Regular security updates

### Kubernetes Security
- Pod security policies
- Network policies
- Resource limits and quotas
- Secret encryption

### Infrastructure Security
- Security groups and NACLs
- IAM roles with least privilege
- Encrypted storage
- Audit logging

## Scaling Architecture

### Horizontal Pod Autoscaling
- CPU and memory-based scaling
- Custom metric scaling
- Cluster autoscaling

### High Availability
- Multi-replica deployments
- Load-balanced services
- Distributed storage
- Backup and recovery

## Technology Decisions

### Why Kubernetes?
- Industry standard for container orchestration
- Rich ecosystem and community support
- Built-in scaling and self-healing
- Declarative configuration

### Why Terraform?
- Infrastructure as Code best practices
- Multi-cloud capability
- State management
- Modular design

### Why Jenkins?
- Mature CI/CD platform
- Extensive plugin ecosystem
- Pipeline-as-code support
- Enterprise features

### Why Prometheus/Grafana?
- Kubernetes-native monitoring
- Powerful query language
- Rich visualization capabilities
- Active community development
